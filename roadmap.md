## 🗓️ **WEEK 1 – Core Design + Patterns Mastery**

### **🩵 Day 1 – OOP & SOLID Deep Dive**

🎯 Goal: Build rock-solid OOP fundamentals
**Topics:**

* OOP Pillars: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
* SOLID Principles with Java examples
* Composition vs Inheritance
* Design Smells (God Object, Tight Coupling, etc.)

**Practice:**

* Design a `Library Management System`
* Identify where SRP, OCP, and DIP apply
* Write 2–3 UML class diagrams

**Outcome:** You can explain why composition is better than inheritance, and refactor code using SOLID.

---

### **🧩 Day 2 – Creational Patterns**

🎯 Goal: Learn object creation flexibility

**Patterns:**

* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype

**Practice:**

* Design a `Logger` (Singleton + Factory)
* Design a `Document Generator` (Builder + Prototype)

**Deliverable:** 5 pattern implementations + UML diagrams

---

### **⚙️ Day 3 – Structural Patterns (Part 1)**

🎯 Goal: Understand composition-based architecture

**Patterns:**

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite

**Practice:**

* `Payment Gateway System` (Bridge)
* `Org Hierarchy / File System` (Composite)
* `Legacy XML to JSON Converter` (Adapter)

**Deliverable:** Class diagrams + Java code per pattern

---

### **⚙️ Day 4 – Structural Patterns (Part 2)**

🎯 Goal: Build real systems by layering decorators and facades

**Patterns:**

* Decorator
* Facade
* Proxy

**Practice:**

* `Stream Processing Pipeline` (Decorator)
* `API Gateway Wrapper` (Facade)
* `Image Loader with Cache` (Proxy)

**Outcome:** You can dynamically wrap functionality and explain trade-offs.

---

### **🧠 Day 5 – Behavioral Patterns (Part 1)**

🎯 Goal: Master dynamic object interactions

**Patterns:**

* Strategy
* Observer
* Command

**Practice:**

* `Notification Service` (Observer + Strategy)
* `Undo/Redo System` (Command)

**Deliverable:** Full working code + UML

---

### **🧠 Day 6 – Behavioral Patterns (Part 2)**

🎯 Goal: Deepen interaction design skills

**Patterns:**

* State
* Chain of Responsibility
* Template Method

**Practice:**

* `Vending Machine / ATM` (State)
* `Logger Framework` (Chain of Responsibility)
* `Report Generator` (Template Method)

**Outcome:** You can model dynamic behavior via state transitions.

---

### **🧩 Day 7 – Review + Pattern Integration**

🎯 Goal: Combine multiple patterns in one system

**Practice Systems:**

* `Food Delivery System` (Strategy + Observer + State)
* `E-Commerce Checkout Flow` (Bridge + Factory + Decorator)

**Bonus:**

* Revise UML Notation (association, aggregation, composition)
* Write one “design doc” (like in interviews)

---

## 🗓️ **WEEK 2 – Real-World LLD Systems + Interview Readiness**

---

### **🔥 Day 8 – LLD Problem 1: Parking Lot System**

🎯 Focus: Real-world modeling
**Concepts:** State, Strategy, Singleton
**Deliverable:** Class diagram, code, entry/exit workflow

---

### **🔥 Day 9 – LLD Problem 2: Online Payment System**

🎯 Focus: Bridge + Strategy + Factory
**Practice:** Add Payment Gateways (Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal)

**Deliverable:** Extensible Java code + UML

---

### **🔥 Day 10 – LLD Problem 3: Notification Service**

🎯 Focus: Observer + Strategy + Decorator
**Goal:** Multi-channel (SMS, Email, Push) notifications with retry logic

---

### **🔥 Day 11 – LLD Problem 4: Cache System**

🎯 Focus: Proxy + Strategy
**Practice:** Design LRU / LFU cache + metrics decorator
**Goal:** Discuss thread-safety + eviction policies

---

### **🔥 Day 12 – LLD Problem 5: Ride Sharing (Uber-like)**

🎯 Focus: Strategy + State + Observer
**Goal:** Model driver matching, ride state transitions, dynamic pricing

---

### **🔥 Day 13 – LLD Problem 6: Chess or Snake & Ladder**

🎯 Focus: State + Command + Strategy
**Goal:** Handle turns, moves, board state management
**Deliverable:** UML + Java implementation of key classes

---

### **📋 Day 14 – Mock Interviews + Recap**

🎯 Goal: Simulate interview conditions

**Task 1:** Pick 2 random problems (e.g., Notification Service + Parking Lot)
**Task 2:**

* Clarify requirements
* Write class diagram
* Justify pattern choices
* Write 2–3 core class implementations
* Discuss extensibility

**Task 3:**

* Review patterns
* Revisit SOLID principles
* Mock interview with a friend / self-record
* Reflect on gaps
